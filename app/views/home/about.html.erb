<div id="content">

<p>DocumentCloud is a catalog of primary source documents and a tool for annotating, organizing and publishing them on the web. Documents are contributed by journalists, researchers and archivists. We're helping reporters get more out of documents and helping newsrooms make their online presence more engaging.</p>

<p>DocumentCloud was founded in 2009 with a grant from the <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/">Knight News Challenge</a>. After two years as an independent nonprofit organization, DocumentCloud <a href="https://blog.documentcloud.org/blog/2011/06/new-home-at-ire/">became a project of Investigative Reporters and Editors</a> in June 2011.
